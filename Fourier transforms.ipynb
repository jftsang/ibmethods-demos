    "If a function is defined on the whole real line and not just a single interval (although it may have finite support), it is not necessarily period. It can have sine-like components at all frequencies (wavenumbers), not just those that are interval multiples of $2\\pi/L$. The 'coefficients' of such a 'continuous series' are the Fourier transform. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the Fourier transform of a function is complex even if the function is real. However, if the function is even about $x = 0$ then its FT is real; if it is odd, then its FT is pure imaginary.\n",

    "Computers can't represent analogue functions exactly. They can only sample them at discrete points, and they can only sample within a finite range (they can't do $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}$ or even $\\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty}$). The Fourier transform of a discretely sampled function is called the **discrete Fourier transform** (DFT) and is an approximation to the Fourier transform of the original analogue function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the sampling occurs at a discrete number of points, there is a limit to the maximum frequency that can be calculated by the DFT. Likewise, because there is a limit to the domain width, there is also a minimum frequency of the DFT."
