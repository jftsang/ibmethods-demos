    "## An ill-posed problem: the backwards heat equation\n",
    "\n",
    "Jacques Hadamard's 1902 paper _Sur les problèmes aux dérivées partielles et leur signification physique_ ([available online](https://it.b-ok.org/book/3335545/2a0afd), a short read in French) is usually cited as the original description of **well-posedness** or **ill-posedness**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well- or ill-posedness can be understood in terms of **continuity of an operator**, in the following sense. Suppose $T(x,t)$ satisfies some linear time-evolution equation, such as the heat equation, with initial conditions $T(x,0) = f(x)$. We shall write $T(x,t) = [(H^t)f](x)$, where the operator $H^t$ means 'evolve the system over a time $t$'; note that it is a linear operator. (We write $t$ as a superscript, as there are properties such as $H^{t_2} H^{t_1} = H^{t_1 + t_2}$.) Say that the operator $H^t$ is continuous (and therefore the solution is well-posed) if for any sequence of functions $f_1, f_2, \\dots $ with $f_i \\rightarrow f$ (in a 'suitable' norm), $H^t f_i \\rightarrow H^t f$. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that in an infinite-dimensional space, linear operators do not necessarily have to be continuous.)\n",
    "\n",
    "By looking at the Fourier series solutions for the heat equation, it can be seen that the time-march operator $H^t$ is continuous for $t \\geq 0$, but discontinuous for $t < 0$: since the amplitudes of modes are multiplied by $\\exp(-n^2 t)$, the highest modes $n\\rightarrow\\infty$ are very large for $t < 0$. Thus, even a slight amount of 'error' in the initial conditions lead to a so-called 'ultraviolet catastrophe', where short-wavelength modes grow unboundedly; the solution itself ceases to be continuous. Ill-posed problems are bad models for physical processes. (The backwards heat equation would imply the increasing concentration of heat at particular locations, in violation of the Second Law.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical solutions of ill-posed equations are almost certainly guaranteed to fail, since numerical methods depend on discretising the domain and assuming that the errors introduced by discretisation are bounded and can be reduced as finer and finer meshes are taken. However, well-posed problems can also be resistant to numerical methods if they are **ill-conditioned** (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condition_number)). Examples include **stiff equations** governed by multiple timescales, one much smaller than the other."
