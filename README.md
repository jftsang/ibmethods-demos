# Demos for Part IB Methods (and maybe other courses)

By [J M F Tsang](j.m.f.tsang@cantab.net). 

The quickest way to use these is with Binder:
https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jftsang/ibmethods-demos/master. But note that
Binder environments expire after a few minutes of inactivity.

These demos are maintained on
[GitHub](https://github.com/jftsang/ibmethods-demos) at
`jftsang/ibmethods-demos`, and I welcome any contributions or
corrections.


## Other course resources

Richard Jozsa's lecture notes from 2013 are probably the best reference
for the material in this course (but check the Schedules). They can be
found (together with many other resources for other courses) at
http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk//user/examples/.

The classic textbook for this course is _Mathematical Methods for
Physics and Engineering_ by Riley, Hobson and Bence, [available at many
libraries](https://idiscover.lib.cam.ac.uk/primo-explore/search?query=any,contains,Riley%20Hobson%20Bence&tab=cam_lib_coll&search_scope=SCOP_CAM_ALL&sortby=rank&vid=44CAM_PROD&facet=frbrgroupid,include,66912111&lang=en_US&offset=0).
It also covers large parts of Variational Principles and Complex
Methods, amongst others (as well as the applied courses in Part IA).
