    "A **Markov process** is a stochastic model for a system, in which the evolution of the system is determined only by the _current_ state of the system, not by any state in the past _(except perhaps through derivatives of the dynamical quantities, where those derivatives exist - often they do not)_. Such a system may be said to possess the **Markov property** ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_property)), or to be 'memoryless'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most famous and elementary types of Markov processes are Markov chains ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain)), which have a discrete set of states (which may be infinite) and evolution between the states takes place in discrete, uniform units of time. However, for some systems a **continuous-time Markov process** may be more appropriate. Under continuous-time evolution, we speak not of 'transition probabilities' but rather of 'transition rates'. This is most important when we care about the dependence of the dynamical properties (_e.g._ the population of a species) on time, and when the rate of change depends on the quantity (_e.g._ higher population implies shorter periods between birth or death events).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the examples below, the dynamical quantities are still assumed to take discrete values; it is only the time between state evolutions that is assumed to be continuous. This makes these CTMPs different from Brownian processes, where the dynamical quantities (_e.g._ position of a particle) are also continuous. \n",
    "\n",
    "At each state, the transition rates to other possible states are given by specifying a transition function, and typically these transitions are assumed to be Poisson processes - with the first event to 'trigger' determining the next state that is visited. The time to transition is therefore distributed according to an exponential distribution.\n"

    "The [Lotka-Volterra equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations) are a family of simple models for the populations of a predator-prey system. The original model is a deterministic dynamical system, consisting of a pair of ordinary differential equations (continuous time, continuous populations). This model is suitable for large populations but leads to the 'atto-fox' problem: populations never become extinct but reach extremely small quantities that are somehow able to bounce back. One resolution is to turn the populations into discrete quantities (you can't have half a fox, or $10^{-18}$ foxes – but you can rescale units to talk in terms of 1000s of foxes, for example). Having done that we can also add uncertainty by introducing a transition function between states."
