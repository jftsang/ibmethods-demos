    "Fourier series of discontinuous (but integrable) functions have extremely poor convergence properties. At a discontinuity, the series converges towards the midpoint of the limits on either side of the discontinuity. The convergence elsewhere is also very slow: in fact, in any neighbourhood of the discontinuity the convergence is pointwise but not uniform. Moreover, the terms in the Fourier series decay very slowly: in the case of the square wave, they fall off as $O(1/n)$. This makes partial sums of the Fourier series poor approximations to the function everywhere, not just near the discontinuity, as oscillatory features remain strong."

    "Amplifying or time-shifting a signal are linear processes: they may change the amplitude and phase of each Fourier mode, but they act on each mode independently. You can think of the Fourier modes as the components of an infinite-dimensional vector, and the linear process as an infinite matrix; since the Fourier modes are eigenfunctions of the differential operator (combining sines and cosines into single terms), this matrix is diagonal.\n",

    "However, many important operations are nonlinear. For example, a microphone recording a very loud input signal transfers an output signal that is clipped, or capped at a peak level. Clipping is a nonlinear process, and as the following demo shows, the clipped function possesses higher harmonics that the non-clipped signal does not possess. The presence of higher harmonics changes the timbre of the sound, and is the principle by which the relatively 'pure' sound of a vibrating string can be magnified into the 'lead'-like sound of an electric guitar. \n",
